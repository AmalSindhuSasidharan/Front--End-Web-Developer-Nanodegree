  <p>What's up bro</p>
  <p>There are many ups and downs since childhood as I, myself only know how I overcome through then. So here are some more solutions to enhance your spirit and to enhathusias for successsfully fulfilling your Nanodegree.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>The best way to improve yourself in difficulty is by taking a <strong>nap</strong> and after that the refreshment helps in learning a lot.</li>
    <li>Wheneever you get stuck somewhere just browse and click on <em>Stackoverflow</em>.</li>
    <li>Try asking the community : from people who would guide you the best.</li>
    <li>Make <u>drawings</u> of your works as it saves a lot of time in winding up with everything.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>At last if there are some wrongs done by you that doesn't mean that <mark>you are actually wrong instead means that you aren't right yet</mark> and just need to work hard on your weak points. I hope that this advice is very much helpful to you in anny problem. At the end of the day it is very much incredible after solving the problems. Last but not the least don't forget your goal and never give up.</p>
  <p>Yours' self</p>
